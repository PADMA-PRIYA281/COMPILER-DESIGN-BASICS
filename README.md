# COMPILER-DESIGN-BASICS

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: GOBIKA ANBAZHAGAN

INTERN ID: CT04DG91

DOMAIN: C PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

This task involved building a lexical analyzer in C that reads code from a file and identifies keywords, identifiers, operators, and string literals. It simulates the first phase of a compiler. The program uses character-by-character parsing and string matching, improving my skills in file handling and token recognition.
